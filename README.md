# Welcome to FixPCTips

## What is this page about?

For quite some time i developed my own knowledge base of common, easy fixes for Windows, and even Linux. I wanted to share it with the public on better platform than one huge .txt file

## How can I explore this wiki?

You can use gitbooks: [https://jakubiakdev.gitbook.io/fixpctips/](https://jakubiakdev.gitbook.io/fixpctips/)

Or browse directly from [github](https://github.com/jakubiakdev/FixPCTips)



## Where did you found those tips?

It was 2-3 years of helping my family and close friends and hours wasted searching for solutions on google. For most of these I can't provide a source, but when I can, I will.

## Why is this page in English and not polish \(my native language\)?

1. I feel like it would be more accessible for everyone around the globe
2. It's kind of a challenge
3. Most of technical terms I only know the English naming, and trying to translate it into polish would be a mess

## Why does the page on gitbooks contain Google Analytics?

Answer is simple: Analytics

I, too don't like anything that tracks me, but I really wanted to know if anyone is even visiting my page. Sending something to the world and not reeving any feedback feels weird.

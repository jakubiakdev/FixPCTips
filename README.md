# Welcome to FixPCTips

## What is this page about?

For quite some time i developed my own knowladge base of common, easy fixes for Windows, and even Linux. I wanted to share it with the public on better platform than one huge .txt file

## How can I explore this wiki?

On the left you should see a list of all the pages, just search for a OS, and the problem you might have.

## Where did you found those tips?

It was 2-3 years of helping my family and close friends and hours wasted searching for solutions on google. For most of these I can't provide a source, but when I can, I will.

## Why is this page in english and not polish \(my native langauge\)?

1. I feel like it would be more accessable for everyone around the globe
2. It's kind of a challange
3. Most of technical terms I only know the english naming, and trying to translate it into polish would be a mess
